    "Q1. What is anomaly detection and what is its purpose?\n",

    "ANS- Anomaly detection is a field of machine learning that deals with the identification of unusual or unexpected events in data. \n",
    "     Anomalies can be caused by a variety of factors, such as errors, fraud, or system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of anomaly detection is to identify these anomalies so that they can be investigated further. This can help to prevent \n",
    "problems, such as fraud or system failures, from occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different anomaly detection techniques available. Some of the most common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rule-based anomaly detection: This technique uses a set of rules to identify anomalies. The rules are typically based on the expected \n",
    "                                 behavior of the data.\n",
    "2. Statistical anomaly detection: This technique uses statistical methods to identify anomalies. The methods typically look for data points \n",
    "                                  that are significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
    "3. Machine learning anomaly detection: This technique uses machine learning models to identify anomalies. The models are typically trained \n",
    "                                       on a dataset of known anomalies and normal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of anomaly detection technique depends on the specific application. For example, rule-based anomaly detection is a good choice \n",

    "                   This can make it difficult to identify the anomalies.\n",

    "          anomalies from noise.\n",
    "4. False positives: Anomaly detection models can generate false positives, meaning that they identify normal data points as anomalies. \n",
